# PixelKeep Refactor (PWA)

PixelKeep is a secure, local-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for managing encrypted notes and quests with a charming retro 8-bit pixel-art aesthetic. It empowers users to take control of their data with client-side encryption and high-performance offline capabilities.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Local-First & Secure:** All data is encrypted using AES-256 (via `crypto-js`) and stored locally in your browser's IndexedDB. No server-side storage means your data belongs to you.
- **High Performance Mode:** New setting to disable encryption for the Quest Log (tasks), allowing for a lightning-fast experience while keeping Notes fully secured.
- **Native OS Integration (PWA):**
    - **Native Share Target:** Share links, text, and files directly to PixelKeep from other apps.
    - **Native File Handling:** Open `.txt`, `.md`, and `.json` files directly within PixelKeep from your device's file manager.
    - **App Shortcuts:** Long-press the icon to jump directly into "New Note" or "New Quest".
    - **Icon Badging:** See your active quest count directly on the app icon.
    - **Robust Offline Support:** Complete precaching of all assets and runtime caching for external fonts.
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Organize notes and quests into nested folders with drag-and-drop support.
- **Rich Note Editing:** 
    - Text formatting (Bold, Italic, Underline, Lists).
    - Multimedia support: Record or upload audio, capture or import images.
    - **Advanced Image Handling:** Resizing and dragging handles for images within the editor.
- **Quest Log (Tasks):** 
    - Track tasks with due dates, locations, and involved people.
    - Custom Alarm/Reminder system with snooze and repeat functionality.
- **Immersive Customization:**
    - Multiple Themes: Standard and "Pixel" (8-bit).
    - Custom Fonts: Support for pixel fonts and modern readable fonts (Inter, Roboto, Exo, etc.).
    - Interface Scaling: Adjust the UI scale to fit your device and preference.
